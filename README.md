BookBox
=============

Brought to you by Ann, Jonathan and Martin.

## What is this?
BookBox is the digital incarnation of the classic hostel/caf√©/street corner Book Swap.

Do you have books lying around that you'll never touch again? Of course you do.

Don't you hate how the library only gives you a week or two to get through a whole book?
HOW FAST DO YOU THINK I READ, LIBRARIANS?

When you swap on BookBox, the new book is yours. Forever. Or until you swap it all over again.

## How does it work?
Simple.
1. Make an account.
2. Pick a book you'd like to swap (the available books are automatically sorted by proximity to you!)
3. Give back to the community, you selfish muppet! Post some of your old books for swapping!

## Have questions?
No you don't! It's too damn simple!
